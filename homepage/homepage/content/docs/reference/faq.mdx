# Frequently Asked Questions

## How established is Jazz?

Jazz is backed by fantastic angel and institutional investors with experience and know-how in devtools and has been in development since 2020.

## Will Jazz be around long-term?

We're committed to Jazz being around for a long time! We understand that when you choose Jazz for your projects, you're investing time and making a significant architectural choice, and we take that responsibility seriously.
That's why we've designed Jazz with longevity in mind from the start:

- The open source nature of our sync server means you'll always be able to run your own infrastructure
- Your data remains accessible even if our cloud services change
- We're designing the protocol as an open specification

This approach creates a foundation that can continue regardless of any single company's involvement. The local-first architecture means your apps will always work, even offline, and your data remains yours.

## How secure is my data?

Jazz encrypts all your data by default using modern cryptographic standards. Every transaction is cryptographically signed, and data is encrypted using industry-standard algorithms including BLAKE3 hashing, Ed25519 signatures, and XSalsa20 stream ciphers.

Key features of Jazz's security:

- **Privacy by default**: Your data is encrypted even on Jazz Cloud servers
- **Automatic key rotation**: When members are removed from Groups, encryption keys rotate automatically
- **Verifiable authenticity**: Every change is cryptographically signed
- **Zero-trust architecture**: Only people you explicitly grant access can read your data

For technical details, see our [encryption documentation](/docs/reference/encryption).

## Does Jazz use Non-standard cryptography?

Jazz uses BLAKE3, XSalsa20, and Ed25519, which are all widely published and publicly reviewed standard cryptographic algorithms.

Although we're not lawyers, and so can't give legal advice, we believe that Jazz does not use 'Non-standard cryptography' as defined in the [BIS requirements](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C/part-772#p-772.1(Non-standard%20cryptography)) and therefore the requirements for publishing Jazz apps in the Apple App Store.
